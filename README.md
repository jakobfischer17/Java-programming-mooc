This repository is to monitor my progress with the Object Oriented programming MOOC from University of Helsinki available here: http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/

My code can be found in the src/xxxxx.java files of each exercise. The code uploaded here has been tested by the TestMyCode plugin provided with the course.
